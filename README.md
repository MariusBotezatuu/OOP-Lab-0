# OOP-Lab-0
1. I followed a youtube video that showed me how to dual boot Ubuntu using a usb by flashing the image to it using a tool called "balenaEtcher". 
Then I decided to shrink the storage space and allocate 50gb for Ubuntu. After this I changed the boot order using BIOS, restarted my laptop and simply 
followed the setup process. It all went smoothly, I didn't encounter any problems.

2. After playing around, testing out certain things and downloading certain personal applications, such as Discord and Telegram, I moved on to step 2, 
downloading the "software engineer starter-pack". Using online tutorials I was able to successfully install zsh, oh-my-zsh, git,gcc and my favorite IDE 
editor, Visual Studio code. To make zsh a bit more personal, I opened the '.zshrc' file to try out different themes. Eventually I decided to use the 
'miloshadzic' theme, as well as 2 plugins. A syntax highlighter and a word complete plugin.

3. On my computer I created a folder called "OOP Lab 0" and put all of my screenshots there. I opened the terminal, went into that folder, and using the
command "touch" I created a file named "Hello.c". After this I went into Visual Studio Code to modify the file into a simple "Hello World" program and 
saved it. To make sure that the program works I decided to use "gcc Hello.c -o Hello" and "./Hello" to run it using the terminal. To make the compiling 
process easier I created a Makefile script for compiling the code, which I put into the "OOP Lab 0" folder. Using terminal I created a git repository there
using "git init". I used "git add" to track all of the files and stage them, after which I used "git commit" to 
commit them with the commentary "added everything". 

In the end, I created a github account, created a repository on there and followed the instructions to connect my local repository to my remote repository.
